Selected Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor as one of the measures to calculate the relative abundance. 
The below paper was referred to which contained a software package called Crux. 
Crux has a tool called spectral-count which could be used to find the NSAF.
Ran into problems with the file format. Crux spectral-tools requires input files with specific format (got error msg 'q-values needed in percolator, q-ranker, barista format')
Decided to ask suggestions for software from the professor.
Another tool we looked at was OpenMS which can be used to try one of the peak intensity methods. 
Ran into problems with installation. Another problem was huge sizes of the mxMl files. Decided to ask the professor about file sizes as well.

Paper

Met up for discussion. The team decided to each select a project pipeline from the literature and discuss on 26/02.
The following papers were circulated
-A New Approach to Evaluating Statistical Significance of Spectral Identifications
    Hosein Mohimani, Sangtae Kim, and Pavel A. Pevzne
-An Automated Pipeline for High-Throughput Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics
  Hendrik Weisser, Sven Nahnsen, Jonas Grossmann, Lars Nilse, Andreas Quandt, Hendrik Brauer,Marc Sturm, Erhan Kenar,
  Oliver Kohlbacher, Ruedi Aebersold, and Lars MalmstroÌˆm

Project Overview was presented.


->19/02/2015 
The project 'Differential Abundance Analysis in Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics' was allocated to group (James Ericson, Angeliki Maraki, aanil).
It is based on a study of LC-MS/MS data analysis conducted by the Proteome Informatics Research group of ABRF.

The presentation for the project overview was prepared.
